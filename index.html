          >Erling Braut Haaland</a
        >
        - (born 21 July 2000), is a Norwegian professional footballer who plays
        as a striker for Premier League club Manchester City and the Norway
        national team. Considered one of the best players in the world, he is
        known for his athleticism, speed and finishing. Coming through the youth
        system, Haaland played at senior level for Bryne's reserve and senior
        teams. He moved to Molde in 2017 (also playing for their reserve team),
        with whom he spent two seasons. Haaland signed with Austrian Bundesliga
        side Red Bull Salzburg in January 2019, winning two league titles and
        one Austrian Cup. In December 2019, he moved to German Bundesliga club
        Borussia Dortmund, where he won the DFB-Pokal in 2020–21. Haaland won
        several individual awards and broke various records during his career.
        During the 2019–20 season with Salzburg, he became the first teenager to
        score in five consecutive UEFA Champions League matches. He was top
        scorer of the Champions League the following season. In 2020, Haaland
        won the Golden Boy award, while in 2021 he was named Bundesliga Player
        of the Season and was included in the FIFA FIFPro World11 in 2021.
        Haaland has represented Norway at various youth levels. In the 2019 FIFA
        U-20 World Cup, he won the tournament's Golden Boot, after scoring a
        record nine goals in a single match. He made his senior international
        debut in September 2019.

        >
        - (born 19 December 1987) is a French professional footballer who plays
        as a striker for La Liga club Real Madrid and the France national team.
        A creative and prolific forward known for his playmaking and finishing,
        Benzema is often regarded as one of the best strikers of all time. He
        ranks as Real Madrid's all-time second-highest goalscorer and all-time
        top assist provider. Born in Lyon to Algerian parents, Benzema began his
        senior career with hometown club Olympique Lyonnais in 2005,
        contributing sporadically to three Ligue 1 title wins. In 2008, he was
        named the league's Player of the Year and in the Team of the Year having
        finished as the league's top goalscorer and winning his fourth league
        title and first Coupe de France. In 2009, Benzema was the subject of a
        then French record football transfer when signed for Real Madrid in a
        transfer worth €35 million. After struggling to establish himself in his
        debut season, he eventually achieved a consistent goalscoring rate with
        the club, and notably went on to be part of a highly rated trio
        alongside Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale — dubbed BBC — who were
        integral to a period where Real Madrid won four UEFA Champions League
        titles from 2014 to 2018.

          >Robert Lewandowski</a
        >
        - (born 21 August 1988) is a Polish professional footballer who plays as
        a striker for La Liga club Barcelona and captains the Poland national
        team. Recognised for his positioning, technique and finishing,
        Lewandowski is considered one of the best strikers of all time, as well
        as one of the most successful players in Bundesliga history. He has
        scored over 600 senior career goals for club and country. After being
        the top scorer in the third and second tiers of Polish football with
        Znicz Pruszków, Lewandowski moved to top-flight Lech Poznań, helping the
        team win the 2009–10 Ekstraklasa. In 2010, he transferred to Borussia
        Dortmund, where he won honors including two consecutive Bundesliga
        titles and the league's top goalscorer award. In 2013, he also featured
        with Dortmund in the 2013 UEFA Champions League Final. Prior to the
        start of the 2014–15 season, Lewandowski agreed to join Dortmund's
        domestic rivals, Bayern Munich, on a free transfer. In Munich, he won
        the Bundesliga title in every one of his eight seasons. Lewandowski was
        integral in Bayern's UEFA Champions League win in 2019–20 as part of a
        treble. He is one of only two players, alongside Johan Cruyff, to
        achieve the European treble while being the highest goalscorer in all
        three competitions, and the first to do it as the sole top scorer.

        is renowned for his dribbling abilities, exceptional speed, and
        finishing. Born in Paris and raised in nearby Bondy, Mbappé began his
        senior club career in 2015 playing for Monaco, where he won the Ligue 1
        title. In 2017, aged 18, Mbappé signed for Paris Saint-Germain on an
        eventual permanent transfer worth €180 million, making him the
        second-most expensive player and most expensive teenage player.[4]
        There, he won four Ligue 1 titles, three Coupes de France, is the club's
        second-highest all-time top goalscorer, and helped the club reach their
        first UEFA Champions League Final in 2020. At international level,
        Mbappé made his senior debut for France in 2017, at age 18. At the 2018
        FIFA World Cup, Mbappé became the youngest French player to score at a
        World Cup, and became the second teenager, after Pelé, to score in a
        World Cup Final. He finished as the joint second-highest goalscorer as
        France won the tournament, and won FIFA World Cup Best Young Player and
        French Player of the Year for his performances. Mbappé was named to the
        FIFA FIFPro World11 in 2018 and 2019, the UEFA Team of the Year in 2018
